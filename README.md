Requirements:

Clients must be able to log in to the back-end and update their data manually with their own login.
Clients must only have access to their own data.
Clients' backend must be white-labelled.
We need to have a backdoor to the clients' backend for troubleshooting. 

Questions: 

What's the safest way to achieve that?
Is it possible to create a sub-domains for each client?
If sub-domains are created, where does the plugin update and maintenance be? can they be done from the original site at once or separately for each sub-domain?
